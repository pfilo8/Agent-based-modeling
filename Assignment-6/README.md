# Reynold Boids Model

In this lab assignment we've implemented Reynold Boids Model.

### Visualization

In order to understand and validate our model we've performed visualizations of the our model.
The model was tested on the following parameters:
* population = 100,
* speed = 3, 
* radius vision = 10, 
* separation_strength = 0.9,
* cohesion_strength = 0.9, 
* alignment_strength = 0.02.

The results can be found in the `results` directory.
